## 📢 Disclosure Policy

This project follows coordinated disclosure:

2. A remediation plan is prepared and validated.
3. Public disclosure is published after a fix, mitigation, or agreed risk decision is available.
4. Credit is attributed in accordance with reporter preference and project policy.

## 🧾 Safe Harbour

If your investigation is conducted in good faith, confined to authorised scope, and disclosed responsibly, the maintainers will not pursue action for policy-compliant activity.

## 🙏 Recognition
